# Tic Tac Toe Game

## Overview
This project implements the classic **Tic Tac Toe** game in C, providing two modes:
1. **Two-Player Mode:** Play with another player on the same device.
2. **Computer Mode:** (Not yet implemented, coming soon!)

The game allows users to fill cells with 'X' or 'O' and follows standard Tic Tac Toe rules.

- **Win Detection:** Automatically detects winners or declares a draw when applicable.
- **Rule Guide:** Learn the rules through an interactive guide before playing.
- **Simple Interface:** Easy-to-use console-based user interface.

## How to Run
1. Compile the code:
   ```bash
   gcc tictactoe.c -o tictactoe
